**Important Considerations for App Shortcuts:**

*   **Local File Paths:** The `file://` protocol is used to create links to local files.
*   **User-Specific Paths:** The example paths (`c:/Users/DrIsaacAndyPhD/...`) are specific to *your* computer. **These will not work for anyone else.**
*   **Distribution:** If you intend to share this repository, you should **not** include these hardcoded file paths.
*   **Alternative Approach (Recommended for Distribution):**
    1.  **Relative Paths:** If the apps are within the repository, use relative paths (e.g., `OVR Builder App`). This will work as long as the user keeps the folder structure intact.
    2. **Instructions:** Instead of direct links, provide clear instructions on how to find and launch the apps. For example:
        ```markdown
        **App Shortcuts (Local)**
        - **OVR Builder:** Navigate to the `Builder` folder and run `OVRBuilder.exe`.
        - **Unity Hub:** Navigate to the `Builder` folder and run `UnityHub.exe`.
        ```
    3. **Batch File:** You could create a batch file that launches the apps and include a shortcut to that batch file in the readme.
* **Security:** Be cautious about distributing executable files. Ensure they are from trusted sources.

**Explanation of Changes:**

1.  **Website Links:**
    *   I've added a section called "**Website Links**" under "Shortcut URLs and Links."
    *   Each link is formatted using Markdown's link syntax: `Link Text`.
    *   I've included example links to the OVR website, documentation, and marketplace, as well as an example of your company website.
    * I've also included a link to the OVR Discord.
2.  **App Shortcuts:**
    *   I've added a section called "**App Shortcuts**" under "Shortcut URLs and Links."
    *   I've used the `file://` protocol to create links to local files.
    *   I've included example links to `OVRBuilder.exe` and `UnityHub.exe`, using your example file paths.
    *   I've added a crucial "**Important Considerations for App Shortcuts**" section to explain the limitations and best practices.
3. **Alternative Approach**
    * I've added a section to the **Important Considerations for App Shortcuts** to explain the alternative approach to distribution.

**Key Improvements:**

*   **Direct Access:** Users can now click directly on the links to visit websites or (if they have the same file structure) launch apps.
*   **Clarity:** The `ReadMe.md` is more organized and easier to understand.
*   **Completeness:** It now includes both website links and app shortcuts.
*   **User-Friendliness:** It's much more convenient for users to get started.
* **Safety:** The important considerations section highlights the safety and distribution issues.
